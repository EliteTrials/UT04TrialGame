# TrialGame for Unreal Tournament 2004

Minor modded version of the Assault gamemode to better suit our beloved trial maps.

## Features

- Brings in three gametypes, one for each submode e.g. Regular Trials, Solo Trials, and Group Trials, commonly known by their acronym (RTR, STR, and GTR).
- Enhancement: Games will not end, only a round will end; this rids us of the annoying winning team announcements.
- Nullified the "You are Attacking!" message.
- Hid redundant server settings that have no use for trial maps.
- Regardless of the gametype being played, the server will lie and tell clients that we are `ASGameInfo`, so that the server will still showup as a regular **Assault** server.
- Custom hints for common abbrevations of trial terms.
- Custom loading screens, if the loading map has a custom screenshot, then that screenshot will be used as a loading screen.
